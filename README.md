## Academic Performance Analysis of Brazilian Schools Dataset
This project analyzes a dataset related to Brazilian schools' academic performance using various data analysis techniques, including clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and supervised learning models, to identify patterns and predict future academic performance.

### Introduction
The dataset consists of information on student grades, school type, location, and other factors that may influence academic performance. The aim of this project is to explore the dataset and provide insights into factors affecting academic performance.

### CRISP-DM Methodology
This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. Each phase is described in detail below.

### Business Understanding
The Business Understanding section describes the context of the data and the research question we aim to answer.

### Data Understanding
The Data Understanding section provides a data dictionary and outlines the process of reading the dataset, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in the data.

### Data Preparation
The Data Preparation section describes the feature engineering process, where we identify and create relevant features for the models. The section also includes dropping irrelevant columns that do not add value to the analysis.

### Modeling
The Modeling section is divided into two parts: Unsupervised Learning and Supervised Learning. The Unsupervised Learning section explores clustering techniques, including KMeans and KMedoids, and evaluates their performance using metrics such as silhouette score and elbow method. The section also includes the use of PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. The Supervised Learning section explores regression and classification models to predict academic performance.

### Evaluation
The Evaluation section compares the performance of the models using various metrics and determines the best-performing models.

### Deployment
The Deployment section describes how the models can be deployed to predict academic performance for future students.

### Techniques Used
This project uses various data analysis techniques, including:

* Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Unsupervised Models
* Supervised Models
* Cross-validation

### Results
The analysis provides insights into factors affecting academic performance and identifies patterns within the data. The models can be used to predict academic performance for future students, which can help educators and policymakers improve educational outcomes.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this project uses various data analysis techniques to explore the dataset and predict future academic performance. The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, and each phase is described in detail. The analysis provides insights into factors affecting academic performance, and the models can be used to predict academic performance for future students, which can help educators and policymakers improve educational outcomes.
